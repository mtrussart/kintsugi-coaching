                  <p class="justify"> This EMBL conference <a href="https://www.embl.de/training/events/2020/GRA20-01/"> Gender Roles and their Impact in Academia </a> focus on exploring our understanding of how gender roles may be shaped by biology and by social structures.
                    Another objective is to assess how the progression of men and women in academic and related careers is influenced by the linkages between biology, society, and gender roles.
                  </p>
                  <p class="justify"> At present not only are workplace gender action plans being put in place to address the under-representation of women in research by supporting and advancing womenâs careers through positive working environments and conditions,
                    also initiatives exposing of women as role models are helping by significantly reducing the prevalence of stereotypes associated with jobs in science, for both women and men. While acknowledging the importance of these factors, we have been examining
                    how to promote gender equality by identifying other individual factors that could contribute to womenâs participation, achievement and progression.
                  <p class="justify"> As part of the Accelerated Leadership Program (WALPP MEL183) organised by Women & Leadership Australia, I conducted an international survey that
                    I presented in a poster that reveals how academics are affected by theirs and othersâ beliefs about their own confidence in their skills and abilities.
                    Identifying such beliefs could contribute to academic success and career progression across all gender.

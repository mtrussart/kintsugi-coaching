            <p> From our experience, typical outcomes for people who commit to coaching include improved leadership skills, the ability to think strategically in terms of outcomes and capability to deliver those outcomes, the ability to maximise goal setting skills to prioritise and mange time more effectively, improved delegation skills, increased knowledge and insights into themselves and their organisation and also more advanced communication skills.
            In our first meeting we will have the opportunity to clearly identify and prioritise the development objectives that you would like to focus on, based on the areas you have identified you would like to work on in our coaching assignement. The coaching agreement will be tailored to your goals and needs ensuring professional ethics (respect, confidentiality about content, coach feedback and transparency. </p>

        			<h2>Gizem Kurt, PhD, Faculty Lecturer at Yasar University and Yoga teacher, Turkey</h2>
        			<p>I can't speak highly enough of Marie. She truly has been a polestar for me. By her empathetic and action-oriented approach, I was able to explore my abilities and reveal my own potential. The sessions we had helped me to think about my needs and my priorities in a way I have never done before. I learned how manage my time better and using goal-setting as a useful tool for proceeding in my career. I have a healthier work life balance that puts on my overall wellbeing day by day. Finally I am so happy that I managed to continue my both career paths as a yoga teacher and a researcher at a university and can find enough time and energy for them both. I am extremely grateful to Marie for sharing her gift with me. If you think you might need a career coach, Marie is the one!</p>

        			<h2>Göknur Giner, PhD, Postdoctoral Researcher at the WEHI Institute of Medical Science, Australia</h2>
        			<p>Marie is a passionate listener and remarkably insightful coach. Besides her distinguished ability to carefully follow the conversation, she has an immense capacity to clear out the mental clutter. Our sessions are like puzzle-solving exercises to me. I give her pieces of thoughts and she helps me connect them all into one big picture. This process allowed me to come to a clearer understanding of what I really want to accomplish and set more tangible goals.
              Coming from research and being involved in the STEMM field as a woman scientist, she relates well to many aspects of my career progression. The powerful questions she asked and the effective flow of our conversations helped me uncover the limiting beliefs and insecurities about my return to work after maternity leave. During my return, she helped me constantly check in with myself and the tasks I spent time on are in line with my goals.
              To me what really sets her apart is her gentle listening skills honoring your perspective and her genuine desire to make a positive impact on people’s life.</p>

        			<h2>Lucille Wagner, Chemical Engineer, Australia</h2>
        			<p>Getting professional coaching sessions is a great gift to yourself. Marie helped me uncover hidden strengths and aspirations I had never acknowledged. She does not assume that she knows what you want. Instead she asks the right questions, she helps you reflect on your answers and pushes you to go down to the bottom of things. Thanks to Marie I realised that not being satisfied by your professional prospects is not a fatality, that there is no such thing as a silly idea and that it is never too late to pursue it. This revelations and others lifted such a weight off my shoulders. It had an incredible impact on my professional prospects as well as on my everyday life and my general feeling of fulfilment and happiness. To anyone that feels demotivated or unhappy or that doesn’t really know what they are doing here or where to go next, I could never recommend enough trying professional coaching. Thank you Marie!</p>

        			<p>I have known Marie Trussart for several years and have been lucky enough to have had a couple of coaching sessions with her. As a coach (and as a person,) she is warm, truly inspiring and supportive throughout. She has really helped me understand and focus my priorities in my life, not just in my career. I highly recommend Marie Trussart’s services in coaching. Here’s to new beginnings!</p>

She made me feel at ease, in a safe place to talk about my conflicts and made those questions that clarified my mind and my heart so that I could feel confident about the decision to take. She is sweet, warm, super smart, sensible and professional. Thank you for your touch!.</p>

              <p>Kintsugi has long represented prevalent philosophical ideas. Namely, the practice is related to the Japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi, which calls for seeing beauty in the flawed or imperfect. The repair method was also born from the Japanese feeling of mottainai, which expresses regret when something is wasted, as well as mushin, the acceptance of change.</p>
